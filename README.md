# mff-tools

A Mobius Final Fantasy toolset. https://woozyking.github.io/mff-tools

## Tools

- [Magicite goals](https://woozyking.github.io/mff-tools/?path=/story/mff-tools--magicite-goal) - the idea is based on https://redd.it/aorptu, with some improvements such as the times are always anchored at server time zone (currently only GL server, UTC -8).
- Jobs table - the data is based on ["the master spreadsheet"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GYuKh0MxhzHdH3fLFd4c0Wahj7zXaIOGSutuQHqDsLc/edit?usp=sharing) (hopefully updated frequently). This is preliminarily done, with basic filters and string search. The goal is to build in more advanced search, so questions such as "warrior jobs with dark, fire, water elements" can be answered relatively easily, or even with damage calculations baked in to answer "ranger jobs with good light un/broken damange". The idea, as well as some early data processing were based on [a revision](https://github.com/woozyking/MobiusFFDamage) of [RichterFF/MobiusFFDamage](https://github.com/RichterFF/MobiusFFDamage).
